# Anoma Data: Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance
## Introduction
Predictive maintenance is crucial across industries to anticipate and prevent machinery and software breakdowns. Anoma Data aims to predict machine breakdowns by identifying anomalies in the data.
## Project Objective
The goal of Anoma Data is to create an automated anomaly detection system for predictive maintenance. This involves a comprehensive pipeline including data collection, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment planning. Success will be measured by achieving over 75% accuracy on the test dataset, implementing hyperparameter tuning, and conducting thorough model validation.
## Data Preparation
### Importing Libraries
Libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning were imported.
### Loading the Dataset
The dataset, comprising of 18,398 rows and 62 columns, was loaded from an Excel file using Pandas.
### Data Exploration and Cleaning
Basic information, duplicates, and missing values were checked. Summary statistics and visualizations were generated to understand the data distribution, class imbalance, outliers, and correlations.
## Model Building
Various machine learning models, including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost, were built and evaluated.
## Model Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, classification report, and threshold were used to assess model performance.
## Cross-Validation
Repeated K-Fold cross-validation was employed to evaluate model performance.
